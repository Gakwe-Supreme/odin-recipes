    <h1>Mexican Taco Recipe</h1>

    <img src="https://www.slenderkitchen.com/sites/default/files/styles/gsd-1x1/public/recipe_images/steak-tacos_0.jpg" alt="Tres Tacos on a plate">
    
    <p>This is the third and final installment of my online cookbook, recipe book, list whatever you want to call it, this is the final one, for now. I plan to add 1 recipe per week.
    Whoich shouldn't be top hard. This one is a family favourite and, it's obvoious as to why. Who doesn't like Mexicans, Mexican food and taco. Strictly speaking, I suppose they
    are burritos, or soft shell tacos but we just call them tacos. Another one of my favourites from my teenage years, again a recipe I've taken on and made my own. Feel free to do the same.
    Iteration after iteration has perfected this recipe over time, adding and subtracting to come up with a tasty, taco built for Tuesdays, or Cinco de Mayo! What a day that is.</p>
    
    <p>Like with all the recipes here, don't skip steps or cut corners by using pre bought ingedients that are packed full of preservatives and taste like MSG on steroids. Marinade that chicken early,
    get tose juices and oils absorbing into that pale pink flesh and skin at your earliest availability. Stock your kitchen full of an array of herbs, spcies and flavours so at the very least,
    your tastebuds feel like they're on holiday, even though your stuck in Scarborough.</p>

        <li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 medium red onion</li>
        <li>1 medium tomato</li>
        <li>1 large avocado</li>
        <li>250g grated cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>300g sour cream</li>
        <li>150g fresh spinach</li>
        <li>3 cups of all purpose white flour</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instrucciones</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Chop the garlic and red onion finely, slice your chosen citrus combination into quarters and take out the seeds.</li>
        <li>Some people like to wash their chicken, do it if this is you, otherwise put it all washed, or not into a bowl or ziplock.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl add all your dry herbs and spices and flavours, that is salt, pepper, cumin, coriander(dry), chilli powder or flakes,
        parika and anything else you might have conjured up. Mix it all together. </li>
        <li>Now add the wet ingredients, 3/4 of the chosen citrus, all the honey, diced garlic, 1/4 of the red onion and two tablespoons of olive oil, into the dry and mix until evenly mixed together.</li>
        <li>Pour the marinade, over the chicken and massage it in, prefarrbly with gloved hands, clean hands at least and use a spatula if your don't like getting your hands on raw animal flesh
        (Your ancestors would be ashamed).</li>
        <li>Cover or close the vessel containing the marinading chicken and refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hours, ideally more than 4 or over night if your an adult and have discipline</li>
        <li>Now you have some time depending on how long your marindaing for but might as well keep prepping and make the taco shells just before the chicken is finished cooking.</li>
        <li>Remove the avocado flesh from the skin, put in a bowl, smash it up with a fork until its the consistency of baby food, squirt in the remaining quarter of citurs grind in the salt, bae and
        finally add 1 tbsp olive oil and some ethnic minority ground pepper. Quacamole, Voila! Cover with suffocating plastic and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Take the remaining red onion, that is finely diced, put it in a bowl, add similarly diced tomato, chopped fresh cilantro, squeeze in another quarter of citrus juice, lime or lemon and finally, 
        crack in a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate. You pico de gallo is complete.</li>
        <li>Grate the cheese into a bowl, cover and refrigerate. Add spinach to a bowl and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>We're going to assume you've marinaded the chicken for the appropriate amount of time and tackle the cooking of the bird. Take a large frying pan, lightly oil, no seed oils, and let it get really hot.</li>
        <li>Pour that marinading chickeny goodness in the pan, make sure it sizzles like a squeeling pig when it hits the hot pan, spread equally so it cooks evenly and cook for 5-10 mintues, probably eight.
        Aiming to brown the one side and reduce some of those juices, don't fiddle with it, let it cook and then flip it, dont let it burn.</li>
        <li>Once flipped, cook for another 5 mins or until you hit an internal temperature of 75 degrees C. Let the chicken rest, cool down and then shred it, using 2 x forks or a knife and a fork.</li>
        <li>Once shredded, put it a serving bowl, get as much of the juices and oils in with it.</li>
        <li>Now we've made it to... <strong>Tortilla Time!</strong> Add the dry ingredients to a well sized bowl, that is the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt, mix it with a spatula or wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Make a well or crater in the centre of the flour mix, add 2 tbsp olive oil and water and mix well, making sure you get all the dry ingredients wet until you get what resembles a dough ball.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a cleaned work counter, chopping board or large, stable, flat surface. Roll the doughball onto and knead that sucker with your heaviest hands for 2 mins, until dough is smooth.</li>
        <li>Divide the keaded doughball into smaller, evenly sized doughball and dust with flour all over. Roll each divison into a ball and flatten with the palm of your hand or a floured rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Cover the flattened doughs with a kitchen towel and let them rise/rst for 45mins</li>
        <li>Alternatively, let the dough rise before dividing into tacos, in the mixing bowl, after covering with suffocating plastic. After an hour, divide and flatten, keeping all surfaces lightly floured.</li>
        <li>Heat a flat frying pan and scarsley oil the bottom. Roughly make circles of each portion of dough, about 10-12cm in diameter and avoid stacking them, they'll stick together and you;ll have a mess.</li>
        <li>Now, when the pan is hot, put one dough portion down and cook for 45 seconds to a minute, so the cooking side has a few brown spots and the top surface is beginning to bubble. Adjust heat as needed.</li>
        <li>Flip that bi.. and cook for another 15-20 seconds on the second side. Remove from heat and stack. Cook all the tacos and cover to keep them warm.</li>
        <li>Now we are ready to plate up and eat.. Finally!</li>
        <li>Build your taco, lay the taco shell down, apply guacamole, shredded chicken, pico de gallo, spincah, sour cream and top with grated cheddar.</li>
        <li>Roll that sucker up like a sushi or a blunt, fold one of the ends up, so it doesn't come pouring out and we are all in for Taco Tuesday.</li>

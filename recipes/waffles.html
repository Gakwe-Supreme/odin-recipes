    <p>This one, once again is a old scchool favourite of mine, been whipping these bad boys up for + 10 years, since I was about 16 or so, I loved food then and I still do.
    When you get a homemade dish, whether sweet or savoury, right, it just cannot be matched... <strong>Win!</strong> These are quick and delicious, the batter can be kept in the fridge for days and
    taken out when you need some Belgian delight in your life.</p>

    <p>These are so much better than the store bought, sodium benzoate, potassium nitrate filled, frozen waffles from Iceland, or wherever you're buying them from.. Don't cut corners,
    stock your kitchen with all the following, necessary, wholseome ingredients and make your grandparents proud. Don't be an NPC. Make your own waffles</p>

    <h2>Wholesome Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all purpose white flour </li>
        <li>1 Tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, seperated</li>
        <li>1/2 cup melted butter (butter not margerine)</li>
        <li>2 cups of whole milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup blueberries</li>
        <li>1/2 cup rasberries/strawberries</li>
        <li>Maple syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add all the dry ingredients, flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, cinnamon and mix them togther.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the ingredients, the wet ones, i.e. milk, butter, vanilla extract and egg yolks, to a medium sized mxing bowl, don't forget to seperate the eggs. 
        Keep the whites seperate. <strong>Apartheid...</strong></li>
        <li>In the seperate bowl, with the <strong>Whites!</strong> beat those whites, like they deserve for all the... until peaks get stiff and look like mini Materhorns. Beat them by hand, with a whisk
        or a hand mixer.</li>
        <li>Now, add the yolk mixture to the dry ingredients and mix well till you get a consistent mixutre of batter, no lumps. You can add extra milk or four of it's too dry or wet but not too much.</li>
        <li>With all that recently learnt, diplomacy, become the best Mandela you can be and take the whites with stiff peaks and fold them, gently, into the waffle mix, folding them in until homogenous.</li>
        <li>Well done Madiba.</li>
        <li>Turn on the waffle iron, or turn it on five minutes ago and lightly grease it with something that's not a seed oil, more butter preferably</li>
        <li>When the waffle iron is hot enough, usually a green light, pour that bad box mixture onto the iron using a ladle or large spoon until the iron is nearly covered, close the top down and secure it.</li>
        <li>Let them <strong>COOK</strong>, and when the green light comes back on, 2-3 minutes, release the top iron and have a look at that Belgian beuty in all her steamy glory.</li>
        <li>Remove from the iron, without buring your hand, plate it, more butter on the waffle, berries and finally, call in the Canadians!</li>
        <li>Drown that Belgian in a sea of maple syrup, like it was crossing the Channel in Operation Dynamo circa. 1940. Eat. Drink. And be Merry!</li>
    </ol>

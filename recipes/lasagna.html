    <h2>Tradtional-ish Italian lasagna</h2>

    <p>A tried and tested recipe, honed to near perfection over the years. Judiciously selected ingredients and a meticulous process that has stood the test of time,
        makes for a tasty Italian treat. One of my favourite dishes since forever.</p>

    <p>It takes some time to make so get ready for an hour and a half in the kitchen, there is some down time but this recipe is a labour of love and well worth it. I like to accompany with a salad, 
    with feta because who doesn't need more cheese. We love cows. It also needs galiic bread, cheesy preferably... like I said ealier, cheese. First of lets make sure we have the right ingredients:</p>

        <li>3 tsp nutmeg</li>
        <li>200g parmesan or simliar cheese</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop the celery, carrot, onion and galic, seperate the galic from the rest as these will go in at different times.</li>
        <li>Take a heavy, high sided frying pan, iron-cast pots are best, put on a moderate to high heat, add olive oil and 2 tsp of butter,let it melt.</li>
        <li>When its hot and starting to sizzle, add the pork mince, break it up into smaller pieces and brown it lightly all over.</li>
        <li> Now add the celery, onion and carrots, mix well and let them soften for 5 mins, mixing them regularly.</li>
        <li>Once soft, add the galic, mix and cook for 1 min more before adding the beef mince, break it up into small pieces again and make sure it gets evenlly spread
            throughout the pan.</li>
        <li>Once browned and the moisture has evaporated, add the red wine and reduce the wine down until there is no water left again</li>
        <li>Now there should be only fats in the bottom of the pan, add the tomato concentrate, tinned tomato, beef stock, fennel seeds, dried basil, oregano and mix it all
            together until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Now reduce the heat to low, cover the ragu, and let it simmer for 45-1 hour or more if possible, mix every now and then, add sugar half way through and water if
            it gets to dry towards the end.</li>
        <li>Whilst the ragu is cooking, melt the rest of the butter, in a small to medium size pot, on a low heat.</li>
        <li>Before it boils, when its melted, remove from heat and add the flour, gently, whisk it into the butter, once mixed, return the mixture
            to heat and mix.</li>
        <li>Add the milk, continue to mix, add the nutmeg, salt and pepper and increase the heat lightly and whisk, dont let it clump.</li>
        <li>The bechamela will thicken with the heat, add the 100g parmesan and 100g cheddar cheese when it starts to warm, mix it in until creamy, should be about 10-15mins</li>
        <li>Let it bubble on a low heat, you can turn it off and reheat when the ragu is finished</li>
        <li>When the ragu is finshed let it rest for 5 mins, you can reheat the bechamela. Then put a thin liayer of ragu on the bottom of your lasagna dish, 
            spread evenly, this is the base.</li>
        <li> Lay lasagna sheets down to cover the base ragu, cover this with another layer of ragu and then a layer of the bechamela, grate a fine layer of parmesan and
            finaly another layer of lasgana sheets. Perpindicliar to the previous layer.</li>
        <li>End off, usually 3 layers, with a sliightly thicker helping of bechamela, parmesan and cheddar on top.</li>
        <li>Put into a pre-heated oven at 200C for 25-30 mins, check it make sure its not getting burnt on top, just brown.</li>
        <li>Take it out after the time and rest for at least 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
